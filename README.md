# Autoencoder Classifier with Fashion MNIST 
In this notebook we will use autoencoder as a classifier with the fashion MNIST dataset. We will build a convolutional autoencoder and use the encoder part of it combined with fully connected layers to classify new samples.

## Data
The dataset can be found on https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
